## The Ultimate Wacky Recipe Maker
We have learned enough skills for a simple, but cool, project!

Remember when you were a kid and thought the ideal dinner would just be all your favorite things mixed in a bowl? How did that Nutella Mac & Cheese taste? **Well - let's come up with a recipe generator to build us an amazing dish for today's evening meal!**
You will need to:

- Create these as a variable:
  1. A type of food
  2. A type of plant
  3. A method of cooking
  4. A word to describe burned food
  5. A household item

- Output a nice looking Recipe page that *concatenates* a dish in this format:
  1. cooking food with burned plant on a bed of item
  
  ### Example (No Peeking the Solution Yet):
  
  ```
  Name a food > Mac & Cheese
  Name a type of plant > Cactus
  Name a method of cooking > Saute        
  What word describes burned food? > Ruined
  Name a DIY item > Hammer

  MENU
  Saute Mac & Cheese with Ruined Cactus on a bed of Hammers
  ```
  
  EXTRA: Remix your recipe to include more variables and a wackier type of dish.
